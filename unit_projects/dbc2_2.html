			<h3>#6. His grave is more or less the only thing to see in the capital of Turkey.</h3>

			<p>Let's be honest, if your thinking about going to Turkey, chances are your talking about Istanbul. But that isn't the capital. Ataturk moved the capital to Ankara when he decided that the Sultan's government in Istanbul had totally sold out.</p><p>That said, Ankara has very little to do. It's plenty nice, but not really for tourism...except for the enormous Anitkbair which is completely beautiful and home to the body of the nation's father. This gorgeous building is some can't miss shit.</p><p>The museum features all of the sweet stuff Ataturk got from other world leaders plus a whole bunch of wax Ataturks and his actual pet dog, taxidermied for historical importance.</p>
		
			<h3>#7. Turkey is still riding his wave...to victory.</h3>

			<p>6.	State of Turkey vs. Its neighbors. Look at all of Turkey's neighbors: Greece, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Now look at Turkey. Get the picture? One of these things is not like the other because one of these things had an Ataturk. It's quite a coincidence that when the financial crisis wrecked the crap out of Greece's economy, Turkey hit an upswing. Curse of Ataturk?</p>

			<h3>#8. This picture.</h3>

			<p>Here is Ataturk at the Battle of Kocatepe. Just look at that picture. War everywhere and this dude is pondering the meaning of all existence. That is some Sun Tzu shit right there. Classic Ataturk. Winning battles with his mind-vice.</p>

			<h3>9. That time he gave everyone a last name.</h3>

			<p>Remember the whole thing about last names? Most Turks didn't have last names until 1934 when Ataturk helped pass the Surname Law. Basically as he was trying to reform Turkey's everything he noticed how hard it was for people to basic things like get mail. Solution: give everyone a last name. Do you know who usually gives you your last name? Your father. Your father of Turks. See what I did there?</p>
