            <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
              <p>
              Where are you viewing this website from? Is it a phone,
              tablet, or computer? Have you ever wondered why a certain webpage looks better on your computer monitor than it does on your small mobile phone? Websites that do not look good across your devices are probably not using responsive web design. Responsive web design is intentionally built to accomadate the everchanging resolutions and sizes of devices in today's world. Basically, this is accomplished using two features: Fluid layouts and media queries.
              </p>
            <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
              <p>
                Have you ever resized a web page using your browser and noticed that the web content is actually moving with it? Web pages are utilizing a fluid grid, a key part to what makes responsive design, "responsive." A fluid grid relies on proportions instead of percentages or pixel widths to determine the size and position of elementsnts. Also known as liquid layouts, the ability to react and change with the browser's scale is extremely important in today's market because of the increasing number of screen resolutions. When a user views a webpage from a high resolution 27" monitor to a tiny screen on a mobile device, they can expect to see all of the elements on the page transform their size in relation with each other. Pretty amazing right? Although fluid layouts made monumental steps forward, it does not solve every problem. Sometimes when the browser's width becomes too narrow, the elements on the site start to severely break down in a chaotic and disorganized fashion. To combat this problem, we go to the next part of responsive design...
              </p>
            <h2>Media Queries</h2>
              <p>Although fluid grids allow for great resizing, sometimes you want to actually eliminate items for mobile viewing or add items for viewing on plus sized monitors. This means having different CSS properties for different screen sizes. The original solution to this problem was to create a "mobile" version or "tablet" version of a website, but thanks to media queries, we can actually keep all of this information in one site.</p>
              <p>Media queries are a way that your webpage can ask the web browser for certain properties of the page, like its size. This means that you can set break points for your site at different screen pixel minimum widths. If the screen has below 320 pixels, you know it's a mobile phone, so you can set your CSS to optomize for the mobile environment by doing things like stacking certain elements or removing sidebars. You can put in as many breakpoints as you'd like, but you probably only need a few.</p>
              <p>The actual CSS required looks like this:</p>
              <img src="http://oi62.tinypic.com/f4kbjk.jpg">
              <p>If you want to see this example in action, re-size this window to 900px and watch the big ugly sidebar turn blue!</p>
              <p>Of course, if you're viewing this site on a mobile device, you're thinking: what sidebar? It's set to disappear completely at 400px so you never even knew it was there. Although color changes might not be the most practical use of media queries, it demonstrates how powerful this tool can be in creating a responsive design.</p>

              <h2>Reflections</h2>
              <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>The basic concepts of responsive design are not difficult: user percentages to create a liquid layout and as a website is resized past certain values, change the positioning of your DIVs. That said, the deisgn aspects were often challenging and deciding where and how things would move, how large elements should be was tricky.</li>
        <li>New technologies and new browsers are continuously changing web design and the way we interact with the web. Phones and tablets only changed standard resolution sizes, which if you think about it is a pretty minor change. What about voice interaction? Right now technologies like Siri are really only being used sparingly, but future web designers might need to consider how users will interact with their sites through voice. Also some screens like those on certain wearable tech devices, are so small that you can't just consider them to be another resolution size. New formats and new ways of showcasing content will evolve to fit these new technologies.</li> 
        <li>Not only can new aural interaction improve the web experience for the visually impaired, this is something that can be addressed with responsive design. Not every website needs a special skin for the visually impaired, but maybe the AARP's website does. Maybe medicare's website does. These institutions have a responsiblity to tailor their services to their users, something that responsive design can help them accomplish.</li> 
        <li>The overall concept of responsive design seems like a much better solution than separate sites. I think the idea of liquid layouts really resonated with me, but I'm still having trouble understanding fluid grids. One issue we ran into when attempting to use a fluid grid was that once you set the number of columns an element was supposed to take up, it wasn't clear how you could re-size the element. For isntance we wanted our content div to be 10 columns at full size, but to be 12 columns at the samllest size.</li>
