			Shereef's Fireside Chat basically confirmed a lot of the things that I have heard or expect from DBC. </p><p> The kitchen vs. restaurant mindset definitely resonated with me. This is an idea that I tried to convey to students when I was a teacher as well. If you sit in class and wait for information to be fed to you, you will never learn as much as someone who is actively engaging in the learning process. Beyond that, it isn't as much fun to sit and stare as it is to become involved in your own learning. In some ways this is easier with a program like DBC because everyone is there by choice, everyone is paying and everyone is coming in with approximately the same baseline of talent.</p><p>I really can't think about this experience without comparing it to my Teach for America experience because both involve brief, intense trainings for completely new and challenging careers. TFA institute was good training but certainly not perfect and I like that DBC acknowledges their own weaknesses off of the bat. You can sit in a crappy session or lecture and complain afterwards to the people around you about how much of a waste of your time it was. Sometimes you just need to vent about stuff like that. But ultimately you need to complement that complaining by actually taking the intiative to figure out what you need to know. If I leave DBC in November and am not competent enough to get a job, DBC is really no worse off. This is a situation where I expect to have to roll with a few punches and stay focused on my ultimate goal.</p><p>The other main point I got from Shereef's video was the mindset that students have towards themselves and thier peers. I think the best thing Shereef said is when he pointed out that most people will find themselves feeling both superior and inferior to their peers at the same time. Being able to withhold that sort of judgment and self-depracation is essential to any workplace, it isn't something special about DBC. I am both really excited to get to know my peers and a little apprehensive about my own knowledge coming in but I'm going to take that nervous energy and use it as motivation to take as much out of phase 0 as possible.
