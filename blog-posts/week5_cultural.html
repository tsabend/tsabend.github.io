<p>One of the essential elements of DBC is paired programming. As knowledgeable as the instructors may be and as efficient as the curriculum here is, the peer group might be the most attractive thing about the program. Pairing helps you learn faster and it sets you up to communicate effectively in the tech world as you will rarely (never) be working on a project completely independently.</p>
<p>So far, pairing has been a positive experience for me. I've been lucky and have paired with a few different people more than once, which allows for us to start building a more comfortable relationship and communication style. On occasion it's been difficult to stick to the driver/navigator scripts that DBC has set out for us because the work we are doing isn't always designed for that relationship, but we've always found a way to use each other effectively. I've never felt "slowed down" by a peer and any time I come to a new conclusion, explaining it to my peer is actually really helpful so that I can internalize my understanding and check my work. Conversely, I haven't felt talked down to either. Even when my pair is navigating or arrives at an answer faster than I do, they always take the time to explain to me where they are in their thought process.</p>
<p>I think the most rewarding pairing experience I've had so far has been working on week 4's creative challenge to create accountability groups. Both my partner and I took turns navigating and pairing and there were a few times we had to just stop and think independently and then share our thoughts. It really was like working with someone on a jig-saw puzzle and having someone to work through difficulties with and to celebrate successes with was enjoyable.</p>
<p>Along with pairing comes feedback. This is something that I feel extremely ready for from a cultural perspective because of my work as an educator. As a teacher, you need to be able to give clear, direct and actionable feedback in a way that will inspire your students to work harder. Feedback in the classroom, isn't just giving out grades and watching students compete. It's creating tasks where students can experience success and growth and celebrating them when they meet and exceed your expectations. Writing feedback comes pretty naturally to me as I feel I can balance being specific and actionable with being kind.</p>
<p>Also as a teacher at Uncommon Schools, feedback was a regular part of my own professional development. Weekly I would get notes from my instructional leader, school leader, or my peers based on classroom observations and I had to reflect on those goals and incorporate them into my teaching. Although the process isn't always comfortable, this ultimately made me a better teacher and after teaching for years in a situation where I had no valuable feedback from school leaders, I thrived on this feedback cycle.</p>
<p>So far at DBC, the feedback I've received has let me know that I'm doing a good job explaining my thoughts and asking questions and that I've been transferring power well and not hogging the job of navigator or hiding behind the role of driver. I haven't had as much valuable constructive feedback as I would like outside of a few technical details (i.e use screencasting as another option to share code). I've gotten plenty of kind and specific feedback, but not enough actionable feedback. Truthfully, this is also the area where I've struggled to write feedback, so I'm not totally surprised. I think that in general it's hard for people to get used to providing honest feedback to others. I also think that given the nature of the paired sessions we've had so far, things may not have been enough of a challenge yet to expose our weaknesses. </p>
<p>I've really enjoyed the pairing so far and I look forward to continuing to become a better programmer that can fulfill all of the roles that title involves. Not just a leader, but a teammate, not just a pair, but a partner.</p>
