		<p>Hello world! For our first technical blog at Devbootcamp we had to compare the design and function of three of our favorite websites. This week we've been learning the basics of HTML and CSS so thinking critcally about the design of sites we enjoy is a natural exercise as we start to consider our own webdesign. I tried to think of three sites that I actually use but that didn't necessarily all follow the same style. Enjoy. </p>
		<h3>thepiratebay.se</h3>
		<div class="contentimage"><img src="./imgs/pbay.png"></div>
		<p>
		One of my favorite sites is thepiratebay.se because it is really great for getting new music and video content. When you arrive at the homepage your eyes are focused on their searchbar, which is centered on the page. This is optimal since the main feature of the site is to search through a list of available torrent files. The homepage is somewhat cluttered compared to a search site like google and it includes a list of links and site information underneath the searchbar that is somewhat distracting. One reason for this is that thepiratebay keeps many of its options visible from the homepage including language preferences, registration/login and how to guides. That being said, the general feature set of the website is fairly barebones, standard search/browse and the main draw of the site is its content: hosted torrent files. </p><p>
Once your off the homepage and into search results and torrent pages, the website has extremely seedy ads taking up huge portions of space. There are literally ads on all four sides of search results plus a few more in the header and in popups. Even worse, certain ads are masked as website features, like download links that take you to paid hosting sites instead of to the torrent file you might expect. This activity is arguably malicious, but you have to account for some amount of give-and-take when you're dealing with a service that is, at absolute best, in a moral grey area. The site seems positioned to take advantage of inexperienced webusers, while providing a few shortcuts for experienced ones through the tiny straight to download shortcuts they provide on search results and the explanations given by hovering over one of these icons. </p><p>
Although other private torrent sites may provide a better user experience, the piratebay is often a go to for people trying to find something popular and it is one of the world's largest filesharing networks. I think one of the things this site demonstrates is that if you offer something that's interesting enough, people will come to your site despite malicious advertising. Obviously they are still competing with other torrent sites and there must be some breakpoint on advertising, but the threshold users consider acceptable is clearly higher, most likely due to the desirability and nature of the content.</p>
<h3>
mint.com</h3>
<div class="contentimage"><img src="./imgs/mint.png"></div>
<p>Another one of my favorite websites is the money managing app Mint. First of all, mint has extremely tasteful branding and the varied light green color scheme gives the site an airy and pleasant feel. In your homepage you have a mix of important personal information and targeted ads for potentially useful services. Unlike thepiratebay which has very little of your private information, mint has access to all of your spending habits. This allows them to target you with very specific ads. Rather than using big blinking sidebars with salacious imagery, mint offers its adservices as "Advice" or "Ways to Save" and tends to place them in divided areas of the main text portion of the homepage while reserving the sidebar for mostly your personal banking information. </p><p>Although I've never purchased any of the financial products directly through the website, I did look through their resources when setting up an IRA and wound up choosing one of the companies they linked to.
Of course the best part of this website is not the homepage which provides a basic bank statement but the transactions and trends sections the former of which allows you to view and categorize transactions from all of your accounts and the latter which offers really cool visualizations of your spending habits over customizable time periods and spending categories.  </p><p>
Another reason this site is attractive is because of its ease of use. I think this is always an important part of a website, but it is especially important when dealing with a financial service since many people may feel generally that financial services are needlessly complicated. The navigation toolbar, which is always on top, makes it really easy to move between these sections. When in the trends section, the sidebar navigation makes it easy to alternate between graphs. Organizing your transactions is as simple as clicking through a menu. The simple navigation helps provide ease of use.</p><p>
Overall, the coolest thing about this site is that it helps me organize my transactions, plan for the future, and it even affects my spending habits offline. </p>
<h3>realclearpolitics.com</h3>
<div class="contentimage"><img src="./imgs/rcp.png"></div>
<p>A final site that I find myself often using is realclearpolitics.com. This website is a blog and news aggregator that focuses on politics, though it has sister sites that focus on other areas of news like realclearmoney, realclearsports etc. This a great place to go when you want a variety of news perspectives on an issue or if you just want to quickly know what's going on in the world. I especially like this particular news aggregator because it has a slight conservative bent so, as a fairly liberal person, I know I can get a variety of viewpoints here. Although I've never purchased anything through the website, every time I click on a link to a news article, I am providing page views to the news organizations that make their money by advertising.</p><p>
When you arrive at the site you are immediately presented with over 30 headlines with red hyperlinks. Despite the enormous volume of information, the website doesn't feel cluttered because these are organized a few different ways. First, I typically find my eyes drawn to the left hand toolbar, which features headlines organized by issue. The black text with the issue names contrasts with the red and allows you to quickly and easily know the day's top stories. To the right, in the main body are links listed under the day of the week. These often link to articles that are related to the issues described on the left but for whatever reason the RCP editorial board have decided they are more important or more something and put them here. </p><p>The final key information is the right hand sidebar, which features a slideshow of headlines including election maps and charts. These maps and the poll aggregations that underlie them are RCPs original claim to fame and they provide quick and simple access to the status of upcoming elections. Here, democratic statistics are given blue text which contrasts with the red and makes information easy to view as well as reminding users of the red blue color divide in American politics. Below the main information on the homepage are links to articles on their sister site as well as links to articles from earlier in the day (the website refreshes its content a few times a day.) and a few sidebars that feature videolinks and advertisements. </p><p>
	The website feels easy to use and the most important information that I'm looking for is always immediately visible. The red, black and blue branding of the site reinforces the political content and the slight change in color after links have been clicked lets me remember which articles I've already viewed. Although I really like the way information is presented on this site, I don't spend that much time on it, as most of the time is spent viewing the links they provide. Even so the feeling I eventually get is one of depression, anxiety and disappointment. Mainly that's caused by the news or by crappy editorials which are just frustrating to read. Why do I keep reading them? I really don't know.
