#U3.W8-9: Grocery List in JavaScript  

## Learning Competencies
- Define functions in JavaScript
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create, add elements to, access, and iterate over arrays in JavaScript
- Create, add properties to, delete properties from, and access values from JavaScript Object literals

## Summary:
Remember your grocery list GPS challenge? Now you will want to re-implement your solution in JavaScript.

You can keep it as a terminal program, OR you can look into creating an HTML version using pure JavaScript. It's up to you how complicated you want to make this. Try using [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to see all of your code interact. (Or you could create your own HTML, CSS, and JS files in this directory and run them in the browser. )
