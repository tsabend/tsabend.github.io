	<p>The realclearpolitics homepage is trying to solve the problem of giving people information. They are trying to give users an easy way to browse many news outlets at the same time. In addition they are trying to drive up traffic by providing some original content. They have a lot of links available so they need a way to organize them so that users don't feel overwhelmed. They also want to be a portal for all of a users websurfing so they want to cross-promote their other platforms (rcmoney, rcsports etc.). They don't just want to show text links, but also want to include videos which are likely to catch user's eyes. They need a place visually to show off some of their original content (especially political racehorse maps) since this is something that differentiates their product and drives traffic to their website. Finally they need to create space for advertisements as that is how they make money.</p>
