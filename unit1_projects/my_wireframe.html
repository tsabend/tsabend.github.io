Website plan:

I want this website to serve as a hub were people can read about me and get links to my technical and cultural blogs. I want to create a fluid grid and show off what I've learned about responsive web deisgn by creating a mobile, ipad and browser version of my layout. 

Div Photoheader
	Large photo that stretches 100% across the display. Text positioned over it

Header: Navigation bar (I want to make this lock at the top so that if you scrolled down it would appear)
		link to technical
		link to cultural
		link to twitter
		link to github

Container: sets margins for the main content

	article space
		short personal bio
	photos
		3 images (display left-right when screen is big and stacked when screen is small)
