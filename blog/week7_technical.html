		<h3>Technical Blog</h3>
		<p>Check out my technical blog where you can find informational posts about various Ruby mehods and programming paradigms. The blogs are a way for me to internalize what I've learned and share some of my growing knowledge with
		others. The best way to learn something is to teach it.</p>

<h1>SQL or Other</h1>
<h5>09:26 AM -- 8/30/14</h5>
<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
<p>SQL is just last Ab Ripper X. You hate it, but you love it. Or sometimes you just hate it. Since first appearing in 1974, SQL has become ubiquitous with database software. SQL uses relational tables to store data and queries the databases for information. Despite, or maybe because of, its popularity SQL has generated a lot of hate. Recently this hate has been focused into the NOSQL movement, which stands for "Not Only QL." NOSQL is a loosely defined concept that basically just means alternative database structures to those used by SQL. So what exactly makes people so angry about SQL and what is the NOSQL movement doing to fix it.</p>
<p>One of the main problems people have with SQL are the relational databases it's built on. Many programmers feel that relational databases don't work well with object oriented programming. Although they are compatible, an object-relational mapping is required to help objects to talk with the data. Furthermore the language of SQL which was designed to be read in a sentence-like fashion quickly becomes difficult to parse when dealing with complex queries. SQL also has difficulties dealing with extremely large datasets, which has caused companies like google to seek out other options. Finally, SQL has been so dominant for so long that it's had a lot of time for people to learn to hate it. It's a 40 year old technology and many people see it as a unfashionable.</p>
<p>NOSQL alternatives don't use relational databases. Instead they use graphs, documents or key-value sets to store data. It's harder to say what NOSQL <strong>is</strong> because it's mostly defined by what it isn't: SQL. Each of these different alternatives has pros and cons, but generally NOSQL can run better with extremely large datasets and can be designed to work more efficiently with OOP. NOSQL is a mere babe compared to the ancient SQL and there is so much variety in NOSQL options that it is harder to evaluate.</p>
<p>Despite the problems with SQL, it is still the boss in the database world. Although relational databases get a lot hate, they are supported by maths which say they are a good decision. Most people don't have the need for huge databases the way that google does, and while NOSQL may seem like a good alternative, it isn't an accident that SQL has survived for 40 years.</p>
<p>In terms of what to learn first, it seems like you should start with SQL. It's widely used and it shapes the debate. Also it has so few commands that it isn't hard to learn the basics. In terms of what to use for your application, the answer will depend on need, but the default is still SQL. SQL has been around long enough that you can expect it to continue to be around in a stable form or years to come. Any given NOSQL option you go with is very new and subject to all sorts of changes. SQL isn't perfect and you may find a need for something else at some point, but don't go NOSQL simply because it's more trendy. Make sure that you really need it before committing to that hot new thing.</p>
