		<h3>Technical Blog</h3>
		<p>Check out my technical blog where you can find informational posts about various Ruby mehods and programming paradigms. The blogs are a way for me to internalize what I've learned and share some of my growing knowledge with
		others. The best way to learn something is to teach it.</p>

				<h1>Why Javascript?</h1>
				<h5>01:36 PM -- 8/2/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>After two weeks of learning html and css, we moved this week into the basics of JavaScript. JavaScript is used to create dynamic aspects of webpages. This is a language that I've heard about for a long, long time, so it was really cool to start playing around with it and getting an idea of the different applications of JavaScript that I've been using without even knowing it.</p>

<p>JavaScript is one of the most popular scripting language for the web. It was originally developed in the mid 90s at Netscape and despite it's name, it isn't closely connected with Java.</p>

<p>One of the reasons JavaScript is so popular is because it is widely supported. Basically every browser can process JavaScript. In addition it. More recently, with the development of node, developers are using JavaScript to manage their back end as well as their front end. One advantage of this setup is that you have additional continuity across your program since everything is in the same language. Finally since it is so popular it has a wealth of resources and an active online community.</p>

<p>Despite it's popularity, JavaScript is criticized as being an amaturish language. Partly this is because it's relatively easy to get JavaScript elements up and running on a website which means that amatures can use it and write amuterish code, it's sort of the flipside of it being relatively easy to get started. Although it is relatively easy to get started, compared to ruby the syntax of JavaScript is complicated. Finally JavaScript has a few strange quirks like no distinguishing floats and integers and overassigning of the + value.</p>

<p>Another limitation of JavaScript (this was more relavent historically) is that without node, it cannot write files to the server and it cannot access local files.</p>

<p>Talking with DBC grads and looking at job postings, I can tell that familiarity with JavaScript is a requirement for many developer jobs. This week was just a brief taste of JavaScript and I can't wait to get more in Phase 2.</p>
