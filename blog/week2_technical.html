		<h3>Technical Blog</h3>
		<p>Check out my technical blog where you can find informational posts about various Ruby mehods and programming paradigms. The blogs are a way for me to internalize what I've learned and share some of my growing knowledge with
		others. The best way to learn something is to teach it.</p>

				<h1>Classes vs. IDs</h1>
				<h5>04:53 PM -- 07/24/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<h3>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3><p>When you're writing the code for your website, you want to change the way that things look and if you want to tell something how it's supposed to look and act you need to find it first. Classes and IDs are a helpful way of pointing to the elements in our html. Here is a basic rundown of their differing applications.</p>
		<h3>IDs</h3><div class="contentimage"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Hello_my_name_is_sticker.svg/1280px-Hello_my_name_is_sticker.svg.png"></div><p>An ID is like a name tag. When you assign an element an ID you can target it just by using its name. This is great for when you have headers, footers or special elements of a page that you want to target quickly and easily. IDs are unique, so no two elements can have the same ID and an element can only have one ID.</p> <p>
Both these requirements are logical and with the analogy of a nametag. If you wrote that your name was Chanel and you see some other girl who just wrote Chanel on her nametag you guys would both be confusing people who were trying to meet guests at the party. Which Chanel was the one I was talking to? Everyone will be asking this question later. Chances are you and/or your fellow Chanel would add some other demarcator like a last initial or last name. No two elements with the same ID.
</p><p>Extending the analogy, you wouldn't put on two nametags at a party right? Then you would just be that guy. Actually maybe you can't put on even one nametag at a party without being that guy. <p>To give an element an ID, just type ID="youridname" after the initial declaration of the element.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html linenums">
&lt;div id="header"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Tim"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id-"whatever"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>To reference an ID in CSS use #youridname</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
#header {
	set the parameters for a perfect header
}
</pre>
<h3>Classes</h3><p>A class is also a way to identify elements, but unlike an ID, a class is not unique. You can have many elements with the same class and an element can have more than one class. This is useful when you want to apply the same formatting to multiple elements, say the font across all the titles and subtitles of your website.</p><div class="contentimage"><img src="http://www.warrenphotographic.co.uk/photography/bigs/08473-Fluffy-ginger-female-kitten.jpg"></div><p>A class is more like a description. See this cat? It is female, fluffy and feline. Each of those descriptors helps to identify it. Those adjectives arenâ€™t uniquely tied to this cat, as other cats could also be given any of these descriptions.</p><p>You should reuse classes whenever you want the same formatting to apply and an element can have more than one class. As far as CSS is concerned there is nothing that you can do with one that you can't do with the other. Mainly if you want the same formatting applied multiple times make your life easier by using classes and if you plan on using it only once, you can use an ID.</p><p>To give an element a class, just type class="yourclassname" after the initial decleration of the element.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
&lt;div class="fluffy female feline"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>To modify the CSS of all the elements with your class name, use ."yourclassname"</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
.fluffy {
	set the parameters of all fluffy things
}
</pre>

<h3>Except...</h3><p>There are a few other minor differences. ID's are a little bit easier to recognize in javascript because of the getElementById function, while classes are modified in javascript through jQuery.</p><p>In addition IDs can be used to navigate around the page. You can use the id as a link that will refocus the page on your identified element.</p><p>That's basically it! Enjoy using these two tools to help identify elements throughout your html.</p><h3>Sources</h3><p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/">http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class</a><a href="
