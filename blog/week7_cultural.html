				<h1>An Under-appreciated Virtue</h1>
				<h5>12:17 PM 8/29/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>For this week's cultural blog, we had to look at a list of values and discuss one that resonated with us. I'm not going to lie, their where some pretty sweet values in their: leadership, friendship, mentorship. All of these are quality ships. But the value that I have chosen to talk about is competence. Competence gets a bad rap, partly because people most often use the word with prefixes like "in" and phrases likes "lack of." Some people seem to consider competence to be a bare minimum assessment. You are a competent at X, but not a master.</p>
				<p>Techinically competence is the ability to get something done succesfully. This is a hugely important ability. Although specialization and mastery are both important, I think that general competence may be even more valuable in the workplace. Over the course of a job you are generally asked to do all kinds of things that aren't in you might never have done. They might not be in your job description. But being competent means that you are able to complete these tasks to a "good enough" standard.</p>
				<p>Competence doesn't stand alone as a virtue, lot's of other ideas go in to being competent. For one thing, you need to be confident in yourself. While researching for last week's stereotype threat blog, I read about how people were either acting or percieved to be acting as less competent because of the influence of the stereotype threat. If people start to doubt that they can do work or if they start worrying about proving themselves to others who they believe doubt them, their competence can be undermined. Confidence is key to competence. Also, competence requires you to accept responsiblity for getting something done and doing everything in your power to accomplish your goal. Being competent doesn't mean you can't ask for some help either. What matters is if you can get stuff done.</p>
				<p>At the same time that competence requires other virtues, I feel strongly that competence underlies some values that are percieved as more impressive. For instance, good leadership is secretly just competence. Many people associate leadership with being charismatic or commanding, but in my experience as a leader and a team member, the best leaders lead by example. They are the people who make sure that everything gets done. That's really just competence: the ability to get stuff done.</p>
				<p>My goal is to leave DBC as a competent programmer. I know that I won't be an expert after a few months of training, but I want to be competent enough to hit the "good enough" bar on serious work. I think that I can use my general competence to help me along the way. I know that I can get stuff done. When work at DBC seems overwhelming or challenging, relying on this general sense of competence should help me acquire the technical expertise to develop a sense of programming competence.
