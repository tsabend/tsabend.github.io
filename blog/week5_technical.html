				<h1>Feeling Classy</h1>
				<h5>09:24 PM -- 8/17/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>This week at DBC, we moved into working with classes and thus began our journey into object oriented programming. In Ruby, where everything is an object, classes seem to be the standard object that people use when creating new functionality for their projects. Classes are objects of the type class. Mainly they help us hold functions, in this case known as methods. Declaring a class is simple:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby linenums">
 class Spy
 end

 james_bond = Spy.new
 jason_bourne = Spy.new
</pre>

				<p>We can make as many instances of the Spy class as we want, but right now it wouldn't be very exciting since the Spy class doesn't do anything. As we add methods to this class we want to think about three different kinds of variables: instance variables, class variables and local variables. Whenever Ruby creates a new class, it looks for an initialize method to run that will help differentiate each instance of the class with some information. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby linenums">
class Spy
  def initialize(weapon)
    @weapon = weapon
  end

  def intimidate
    "Don't make me hurt you with my #{@weapon}!"
  end
end

james_bond = Spy.new("Walther PPK")
jason_bourne = Spy.new("Forehead")

james_bond.intimidate
 => "Don't make me hurt you with my Walther PPK!" 

jason_bourne.intimidate
 => "Don't make me hurt you with my Forehead!" 
</pre>

				<p>In this example, initialize was asking for a variable called weapon. Then the local variable weapon that is generated by the method argument is assigned to an instance variable @weapon. Instance variables are signified by the '@' symbol. This is a great way to share information between methods within a class. Without the @, variables are just local and can't be seen from method to method even if they're in the same class. Instance variables can be seen by <strong>any</strong> method within that instance of the class. </p>
				<p>I can have other methods use @weapon to determine their functionaity (like intimidate is doing here) or I can even change that instance variable in other methods (imagine a "disarm" method that set weapon to "hands"). Instance variables can be declared at initialization or later and no matter what they can only be read within an instance of a class. That's useful because it means we can have all sorts of spies with all sorts of different weapons.</p>
				<p>The other special variable available in this situation is called a class variable. Class variables are signified by @@ and like instance variables they have a wider scope than local variables. In fact, class variables can be seen by all instances of a class. Check it out below.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby linenum">
class Spy
  @@drink = "Vodka Martini (Shaken Not Stirred)."

  def order
    "I'll have a #{@@drink}."
  end

  def drink=(value)
    @@drink = value
  end
end

james_bond = Spy.new
jason_bourne = Spy.new

james_bond.order
 => "I'll have a Vodka Martini (Shaken Not Stirred)."

jason_bourne.order
 => "I'll have a Vodka Martini (Shaken Not Stirred)."

jason_bourne.drink = "Memory Altering Drug."

james_bond.order
 => "I'll have a Memory Altering Drug."

jason_bourne.order
 => "I'll have a Memory Altering Drug."
</pre>
				<p>Now the first time we call drink and they both order Vodka Martinis, we might not be seeing any truly new functionality. After all, that is the default value when the class is built and they didn't have a chance to enter their drink preferences. The new functionality comes from when we change Jason's drink to a Memory Altering Drug. James' drink changes too! But we didn't do anything to James at all!</p><p>Fear not, you are not suffering from Jason Bourne's drink of choice (seriously bro, be easy on that stuff). Instead you are seeing the power of class variables. When you set or change a class variable, every instance of that class will inherit that change. This makes them extremely powerful and potentially dangerous if misused. Sometimes we want to know something about all the instances of a class. For example, you can use a class varible to keep track of how many times your class has been instantiated or you could store some data structure as a class variable and update it every time a new instance is created so that all instances can have access to information about all other instances.</p>
				<p>There you have it, classes, @instance variables and @@class variables. Hopefully, this helped you understand the diferences.</p>
