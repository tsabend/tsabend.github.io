				<h1>Learning Styles</h1>
				<h5>11:26 AM -- 8/3/14 </h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>
			One of our prep requirements was taking a Gregorc Thinking Style Inventory. My results showed that I was most strongly an abstract sequential thinker. Given my undergrad experience with philosophy I was totally unsurprised by this. It's fitting even that my initial reaction to the test was a stereotypically abstract random reaction: I was skeptical and I looked for experts and references that confirmed or denied the reliability of the test. Ultimately what I found was somewhat unsurprising: there isn't a ton of evidence supporting Gregorc's analysis and the whole thing feels like a cold read. That said, (or perhaps because of that) I did find a lot of the information on AS thinkers applicable to my learning style.</p>

			<p>Much like a stereotypical AS thinker, I definitely find that I struggle with repetitive tasks and too many rules. One source described an AS student as the kind who dislikes when the teacher yells at all the students for the actions of a few. I also think that I like to analyze situations before acting, and having a stimulating work environment.</p>

			<p>But in so many ways I think this describes the student I was in high school and not the student I am today. Being put into environments where I've been exposed to people with vastly different background or situations in which I have struggled and had to respond to failure has helped me seek out multiple solutions to problems including those that rely on more emotional grounds.</p>

			<p>Honestly, my biggest struggles so far in phase-0 have all been logistical because I've been travelling. No amount of rationalization can save you when the internet dies inexplicably in your apartment 3 minutes before your GPS session. Now that my trip is coming to a close (I fly back from Istanbul today) I have the luxury of not working while I finish phase-0. </p>

			<p>But I know this bounty of available work time won't always be the available. One of the AS learning style difficulties is having too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly. This is going to be a problem when I get to DBC and the pace of my work increases dramatically. When I was teaching this problem existed also. There was always more work to do than could be possibly done within the time constraints. Literally a teacher has an infinite amount of potential work, though it isn't all equally important. I'm going to need to not let this stress me out and instead focus on the most important skills and objectives.</p>

			<p>Looking at my full Gregorc results I had moderately high scores for CR and CS thinking and almost no points in the AR section. Abstract random learners are traditionally the more emotional and touchy feely type and although I think that listening to others is essential and valuable, I wouldn't say that it is my default position as a learner. But this learning style also excels at focusing on the issues at hand, which as I just said will be a key part of my struggle at DBC. This is something that I can improve, but will need to work on actively.
