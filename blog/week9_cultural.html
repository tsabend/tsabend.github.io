				<h1>Questions and Research</h1>
				<h5>1:27 PM 9/13/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>Most students, especially in middle school, often think that you show class participation by raising your hand to answer questions. It seems like the easiest way to make your teacher happy. They ask a question and you answer it. But the truth is that teacher's would much rather see you raise your hand to ask a question than to answer one. Answering questions is a way to show off what you know, but asking questions is a way to really push yourself and learn.</p>
				<p>Of course, not all questions are created equally. The old cliche claims that there are "no stupid questions" but when enough kids ask you how many sentences a response needs to be, you realize that at the very least, not all questions are created equally. Problematic questions aren't always about trivial topics. Sometimes questions are posed so vaguely or are so tangential to the matter at hand that they are just unhelpful.</p>
				<p>As someone who is transitioning to a new field, I find myself asking questions all the time. I can't imagine trying to learn what I'm learning without the wealth of resources that the internet provides. But it isn't only novices who reach out for help. The process of formulating and researching questions is one that even expert programmers engage in. Thinking back to my post a few weeks ago on competence, I would argue that this is a key skill to being a competent computer programmer. So what are the keys to success?</p>
				<p>First of all you need to identify your problem as specifically as possible. Read through your error message or investigate the buggy functionality and determine as close as possible what is going wrong. Next, summarize your problem in a one sentence search term. Stack Overflow recommends that their posters use specific titles for their questions that clearly outline their problem. This helps the poster get results quickly and it also helps future askers by making the information easy to find.</p>
				<p> When asking questions in person, you may find that you have multiple questions and multiple problems. Try to stick to just one thing at a time and don't derail yourself by trying to tackle multiple unrelated problems at once. It's tempting to get all of the help you can when you have someone's attention, but by fixing one error at a time you will be more productive in the end. Also make sure that you've exhausted online resources or other research before asking a question. The chances are that someone else has had the same or similar problem and it's a much more sustainable habit than asking a teacher.</p>
				<p>If you find that you need to ask a question online, make sure that you're question is specifc and accompanied by the exact code your working with or a substitute that does the same thing. Because there are so many different options to solve most problems, knowing your exact requirements can help posters give you the best answers possible. Also make sure that you're respecting people's time by writing in clear, gramatically correct english. It's the least you can do. Finally, engage with responders. Whether this is asking a follow up question, reading through provided resources or just saying thanks, it's good to appreciate the people who are taking their time to help you.</p>
				<p>I've been really blown away by the quality of information available on the web. It's great to have such an amazing community that is so willing to help people learn. Although right now I'm spending more time researching and asking questions, I'm excited that soon, I'll be answering questions too.</p>
