				<h1>Conflict</h1>
				<h5>9:17 PM 9/7/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>Whenever two people work extremely closely with one another, conflicts are bound to arise. Not all conflicts are necessarily bad, and there are more than a few awesome rock records focused on and inspired by internal conflict.</p>
				<p>But most of us aren't Lennon or McCartney and our emotional disputes don't generate The White Album, or even Let it Be. Whenever people's creative vision clashes or when one person feels they are shouldering an unfair portion of the work, conflict arises.</p>
				<p>There are all sorts of cliches about conflict and conflict resolution, many of which also happen to be true. Still, it's hard to be really honest with yourself about conflicts.Try to think about the last time you had a conflict. Who was to blame? Chances are you are thinking of a conflict in which the other party was to blame. How many people are really willing to say that they were the one's being petty, irrational, controlling or selfish. The truth is that conflict can be shame inducing and people deal with that emotion in different ways.</p>
				<p>When I try to think about conflicts I've had, I often find myself succumbing to this same egotism. I like to think that I do a good job of not displacing my feelings on others, that I consider things from the other party's point of view and that I always work to find common ground and stay solutions oriented. But that's something we all like to think. The truth is that we have all been on both sides of a conflict as the person bearing the brunt of some misplaced stress or anger and as the person who just needs to vent or refuses to give up control.</p>
				<p>One thing that I have found helpful in resolving long term conflicts is to focus on building a personal relationship with the other person in ways that don't involve the conflict at all.</p>
				<p>I don't think that all conflict is avoidable but I do think that good communication is important to containing conflicts and preventing them from becoming detrimental. You need to consider moments of conflict within the context of a larger interpersonal relationship. These relationships are complicated and they are going to exist over a long period of time. Hopefully, by listening to others and developing those relationships you are left with fewer conflicts that are really destructive.</p>
