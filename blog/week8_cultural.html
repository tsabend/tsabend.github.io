				<h1>Conflict</h1>
				<h5>9:17 PM 9/7/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>Whenever two people work extremely closely with one another, conflicts are bound to arise. Not all conflicts are necessarily bad, and there are more than a few awesome rock records focused on and inspired by internal conflict from Beatles' White Album to the Unicorn's Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone? </p>
				<p>But most of us aren't Lennon or McCartney. Whenever people's creative vision clashes or when one person feels they are shouldering an unfair portion of the work, conflict arises.</p>
				<p>My co-teacher and I had more than our fair share of emotional conflicts as she would readily admit. Especially during our first six months of working together, we struggled to communicate effectively and it affected the quality of our work.</p>
				<p>Although we would fight about things like which objectives to prioritize, the correct interpretation of a particular passage or the division of a week of planning, the conflict had underlying causes that we didn't really address. She liked her plans to be extremely detailed in aspects that I didn't think were important. She would spend hours working on things that I didn't find useful so she resented me for working less. Furthermore, she had been with the school for longer and felt that by sharing this responsibility with her I was undermining her position.</p>
				<p>Things definitely got worse before they got better. Each of us had our own faults. She was sometimes over emotional and communicated passive-aggressively through text messaging. I was at times condescending or else tried to ignore the problems. Things finally came to a head in December of the school year right before Christmas break at a time when we both sorely needed a break.</p>
				<p>That break gave me time to reflect on our relationship and consider what I could do to improve things. We both came back rested and apologetic and started to work towards creating a more effective partnership. I can't really say exactly what we did to work better together because it was a combination of so many things. Eventually we were able to look back and laugh at the heated dynamic that had once existed between us. We still had disagreements but we each knew when to give the other person space or when to give up on some small point that really didn't matter</p>
				<p>I don't think that all conflict is avoidable but I do think that good communication is important to containing conflicts and preventing them from becoming detrimental. In today's work environment I think that the medium of communication is really important. Some conversations need to be had face-to-face. I also think that you need to consider moments of conflict within the context of a larger interpersonal relationship. These relationships are complicated and they are going to exist over a long period of time. Hopefully, by listening to others and developing those relationships you are left with fewer conflicts that are really destructive.</p>
