				<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
				<h5>02:38 PM 8/21/14</h5>
				<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
				<p>The stereotype threat is a psychological theory that helps to explain certain differences in performance between different kinds of people. The basic premise is that when a stereotype exists about a group, individuals of that group will perform worse in related scenarios because of the stereotype. The classic study that spawned research into this field was conducted in 1995 study by Stanford psychologists Steele and Aronson.</p>
				<p>When they gave standardized tests to African-American and white students, they found that both groups performed equally, but emphasizing an existing stereotype about poor test performance by African-Americans reduced the scores of those students substantially. Just emphasizing the stereotype was enough to change performance. The initial experiment concerned race, but hundreds of follow up studies and experiments have been conducted to verify and expand these results and stereotype threat phenomena have been documented not just around racial stereotypes but also around gender, age and immigration status.</p>
				<p>Steele's explanation of these differences was that the additional mental baggage of trying to beat the stereotype was causing these students to perform worse. This is a key point that critics of the stereotype threat often misunderstand. The point isn't that these students perform worse because they are internalizing a stereotype and are losing confidence in themselves. Even people who vehemently deny the existence of a stereotype could still suffer from stereotype threat because of the energy they expend thinking about the stereotype. Finally, even when a stereotype is positive, the added pressure of conforming to that positive stereotype can also reduce performance.</p>
				<p>The stereotype threat is not a "silver bullet" that explains all disparities in performance based on demographic differences. Sometimes people may actually internalize a stereotype and handicap themselves, sometimes a task is inherently discriminatory, and at an individual level it is always possible that a person fits a stereotype. Still, the stereotype threat research demonstrates the impact that stereotypes have on all of us whether we believe them or not.</p>
				<p>At both of the schools where I taught, nearly 100% of the students where African-American or Latino. At my school in Newark, we talked to students about the gender and racial disparities in high-paying STEM industries. We emphasized that intelligence is malleable and that if they worked hard, nothing could keep them from those skills and those jobs. Providing role models can help and we took them on a trip to google's headquarters in Mountain View where they met google employees who proved that people like them belonged in tech. I would love to see my students taking AP computer science in high school and choosing to become engineers.</p>
				<p>Now that I'm transitioning into this world, I want to make sure that I am not part of the problem for women or minorities in tech. Nationally, well over 80% of middle school English teachers are women. Under 25% of computer programmers are women. This means that for the past four years most of my mentors and peers have been female and next year, most of my mentors and peers are likely to be male. These two fields are on opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of gender. There might be several explanations of why there aren't as many women in tech, but the stereotype threat (as well as explicit discrimination) surely plays a role. Given that tech is a major growth industry, I hope that in the very near future these statistics start to change and more women enter the tech field. I certainly hope that my female students, many of whom were excellent mathematicians, would feel comfortable pursuing a career as a programmer.<p>
				<p>Given that I don't want to inflict stereotype threat effects on those around me, what acitons should I take or not take? I think this is where things get especially difficult. The website reducingstereotypethreat.org has several suggestions about what you can do to reduce the effects of stereotype threat based on the research psychologists have done on the effect, but most of the suggestions are things that parents or educators could do. Wanting to reduce stereotype threat effects might be a comendable idea but specifically acting in a way to reduce those effects seems condescending, as if my behavior were really that important to some other person's performance. I think one clear thing NOT to do, is bring up or perpetuate these stereotypes. The whole point of these studies is that priming people with the stereotype creates negative effects, so it seems like the less you discuss the stereotype the less effects you will see.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, I really like the conclusion reached by the npr story on stereotype threats. The best way to eliminate stereotype threat effects? End the stereotype. When women make up 50% of the math teachers, professors and tech workforce, and when the stereotype becomes how great women are at math, the effect will disappear.</p>
