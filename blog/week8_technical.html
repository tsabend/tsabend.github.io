		<h3>Technical Blog</h3>
		<p>Check out my technical blog where you can find informational posts about various Ruby mehods and programming paradigms. The blogs are a way for me to internalize what I've learned and share some of my growing knowledge with
		others. The best way to learn something is to teach it.</p>

<h1>Test Driven Development</h1>
<h5>06:18 PM -- 9/7/14</h5>
<h5>Thomas Abend</h5>
<p>Regardless of your medium, planning is probably the most important part of any creative medium. Writers use outlines, painters make sketches, directors create storyboards, musicians will record demos, architects create blueprints. Even chefs will emphasize the importance of mise en place, the process of organizing and preparing your materials. Planning is not a crutch for beginners, it's one of the processes that helps separate the experts from the beginners. Teach for America emphasizes the importance of "backwards planning" your lessons. Start with how you will know if your students are successful and work backwards to plan how to get them to this end goal.</p>
<p>Test driven development (TDD) is a coding paradigm that follows the logic of backwards planning. Start with what you want your code to be able to do. Establish that firmly before writing your code. Although the process of planning code can be split into several steps including whiteboarding, writing pseudocode or creating diagrams and flowcharts, your tests are what ultimately determine the functionality of the application you create.</p>
<p>At some level, all code gets tested. What TDD means is that you are beginning with the tests. If you wanted to write a method that multiplied two numbers. You'd test to see if the result of passing 2 and 3 to the method was 6. At this point, your test will fail. You haven't actually written anything yet. Next you write the most simple program you can to make the test pass.</p>
<p>There is a broad range of benefits to TDD. For one thing, tests help to break up your application into smaller problems. Rather than having to tackle the whole thing at once, you can move one test at a time. This chunking can also help you create code that is well designed and has few dependencies and is thus easier to change. Creating tests allows you to more easily see bugs after making changes to your program. If a feature or intermediate step stops working, your tests will let you know.</p>
<p>TDD has become very popular in recent years which has led to some backlash. TDD does have some shortcomings, but they are often practical rather than philosophical. The biggest issue with TDD is that it is time consuming and thus costly. There comes a point at which creating a test for everything may have diminishing returns, especially if you are an expert developer. Additionally, if you aren't writing good tests, you won't get most of the benefits of TDD. In that sense you've just shifted the burden of your work from writing good code to writing good tests. </p>
<p>Overall, I think that the benefits of TDD far outweigh the additional time involved. This is especially true as a new programmer. Writing tests first ultimately keeps me more productive because I always know what my goal is and what my program should be doing. It also allows me to feel successful in a way that keeps me productive. Having tests pass is a little like checking things off of a to do list. The whole list might not be empty, but you feel good every time something gets crossed off. Finally, even though some experts may feel that TDD is impractical at times and winds up costing them time, the advantage of TDD is that your code has some protections against being screwed around with by those less expert than yourself.</p>
<p>At least for now, TDD is a process that I plan on using for all of my applications. This should help keep my code loosely coupled and my mind productive.</p>
